# 👋 Welcome to My 3D & VR Game Development Space

Hi, I’m **David Ton**, a developer passionate about creating **immersive 3D and VR experiences**.  
This site serves as both a portfolio and a documentation hub for my projects in **interactive entertainment**, **virtual worlds**, and **cutting-edge gameplay mechanics**.

## 🎮 About Me

I specialize in:
- **3D Game Development**: Building interactive environments and gameplay systems using engines like *Unity* and *Unreal Engine*.  
- **Virtual Reality (VR)**: Designing intuitive VR interactions and comfort-focused mechanics to push the boundaries of immersion.  
- **Graphics & Optimization**: Crafting shaders, optimizing performance, and achieving smooth experiences across devices.  
- **Gameplay Systems**: Experimenting with physics-driven mechanics, AI-driven interactions, and multiplayer networking.  

I’m motivated by the idea of turning **imagination into experiences** that players can not only see—but step into.

## 🌌 Closing Note

VR and 3D game development are evolving at an incredible pace.  
My mission is to explore **new ways of storytelling, gameplay, and interaction**—building worlds that players don’t just play, but *inhabit*.  

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you’ll enjoy exploring my work!
